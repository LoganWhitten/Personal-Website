Working with GrandMA3 with a pre-designed  rig was a unique challenge that I was able to learn a tremendous amount from.  I made the decision early on
that I only wanted palletized data, and later began using only recipies. The final project can be viewed below. I am very excited to continue using MA3
for projects in the future.
